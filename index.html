  <p>
      I have been a dog lover for all my life. I had german shepherd, few mixed dogs, and my favorite one which i have right now is a husky.

            Husky is a general name for a sled-type of dog used in northern regions, differentiated from other sled-dog types by their fast 
            pulling style. They are an ever-changing cross-breed of the fastest dogs. The Alaskan Malamute, by contrast, is "the largest and 
            most powerful" sled dog, and was used for heavier loads. Huskies are used in sled dog racing. In recent years, companies have been 
            marketing tourist treks with dog sledges for adventure travelers in snow regions as well. Huskies are also today kept as pets, 
            and groups work to find new pet homes for retired racing and adventure trekking dogs.
